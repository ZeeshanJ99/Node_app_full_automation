## Kieron, Akunma, Amy - **Automation with Jenkins**

### Gatling Testing - needs to build a Jenkins server with required plugins/dependencies - 

### Delete jobs in Jenkins - leave three successful jobs

<br>

Firstly we need to build a Jenkins server in Ireland from the Jenkins AMI in London
 - We must make sure the the server is NOT **t2micro** because we need a bigger server (**medium** should be good)
 - After creating the server, we should check the plugins already available
 - If they're not installed, then we need to add plugins for Gatling, Ansible and Terraform

We have to communicate with other teams to make the Jenkins automation server.
